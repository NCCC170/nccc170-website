title: Analysis of Generalized Linear Mixed Models in the Agricultural and Natural
  Resources Sciences
abstract: <i>Analysis of Generalized Linear Mixed Models in the Agricultural and Natural
  Resources Sciences</i> provides readers with an understanding and appreciation for
  the design and analysis of mixed models for non-normally distributed data. It is
  the only publication of its kind directed specifically toward the agricultural and
  natural resources sciences audience. Readers will especially benefit from the numerous
  worked examples based on actual experimental data and the discussion of pitfalls
  associated with incorrect analyses.

<i>Analysis of Generalized Linear Mixed Models in the Agricultural and Natural Resources Sciences</i> was written by members of NCCC170 as part of the project’s educational outreach. The authors were Edward Gbur, Walter Stroup, Kevin McCarter, Susan Durham, Linda Young, Mary Christman, Mark West and Matthew Kramer. The book was published in 2012 by the American Society of Agronomy.

## Data Files for Selected Examples

Data files are provided here to allow readers to recreate the analyses of the examples in the book. All of them are text files. The first few lines of each file provide information on its contents. No SAS coding has been provided. Some files contain modified versions or subsets of data that were used in publications. The modifications were made to enable us to illustrate specific concepts and issues. As stated in the book, they are not intended to be the basis for drawing subject matter conclusions but rather to demonstrate the wide range of research settings to which generalized linear mixed models can be applied. A few files are part of ongoing research projects and/or manuscripts under consideration for publication.
