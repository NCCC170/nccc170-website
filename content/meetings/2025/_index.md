**Visit the University of Idaho, located in the Palouse!** Home of the highest yielding wheat acreage in the world and also the lentil capital of the world. The 1500-acre campus is located on the western side of Moscow, Idaho, two miles from the Washington state line and seven miles from Washington State University. Palouse agriculture is largely defined by dryland/rainfed small grains production, and some canola acreage. Summers are a very pleasant time in Moscow with warm days, cool nights, and less traffic and waiting since half of the town (the students) is largely absent. The daily highs are usually in the mid-70s (°F) and the lows are in the mid-40’s. 

The meeting will be held on June 5–6, 2025, at the University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho.
See the [NIMMS Meeting Authorization](https://nimss.org/meetings/52849).

The week of the NCCC-170 meeting coincides with the annual statewide FFA convention so housing will be tight. Reservations should be made promptly. 

The information below now has a hotel reservation link. Please book by May 23, 2025 to receive the group rate. Also below is information on:
 1. Information on several hotels in the area (including the main one with a small block of rooms)
 2. Air and ground transportation (we may want to set up a carpool list)
 3. Activities around Moscow, including a possible Snake river trip on Wednesday the 4th with evening dinner at Bill Price's house Wednesday evening.



### Hotels 

*There are several within a 30-minute walk (or less) from campus:* 

* [Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/puwfi-fairfield-inn-and-suites-moscow/overview/) – Newest and quite nice, very close to campus and affordable. We have a small block of rooms reserved for NCCC-170 for ($170 – this is coincidental). [Reservation Link](https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?guestreslink2=true&id=1740697332321&key=GRP)
* [Best Western Plus University Inn](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-moscow/best-western-plus-university-inn/propertyCode.13035.html) – fanciest, probably the most family friendly (has a pool), close to campus
* [The Monarch Motel](http://moscowmonarch.com/) – hipster hotel, great downtown location, fun vibe, close to campus
* [FairBridge Inn & Suites](https://fairbridgeinns.com/hotel/moscow-pullman-idaho) – recently renovated/rebranded, also close to campus

The week of the NCCC-170 also coincides with the annual statewide FFA convention, so housing will be very tight. Please make your housing reservations soon! 

### Potential Wednesday plans  (day and evening)

I would like to invite people to join me on a jet boat tour of the Snake River Wednesday, June 4th. This starts at 8 am, takes 4 hours and will cost $196 per person. It is a beautiful trip through Idaho’s gorgeous Hells Canyon, and a bit of wild ride (watch [their video](https://snakeriveradventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Snake-River-Adventures-Clips.mp4) to see what I mean). Since it is an extra-curricular activity, you each need to make your reservations directly with the company, [Snake River Adventures](https://snakeriveradventures.com/).

We will also hold an evening dinner Wednesday, June 4th, at Bill Price’s house in Deary, Idaho.

### Ground Transportation

[Moscow Taxi](https://www.taximoscowid.com/airport-transportation/) provides transportation to all airports (Lewiston and Spokane requires minimum 24 hours advance notice). The costs are for a one-way trip:

- Moscow to Pullman Airport: $30
- Moscow to Lewiston Airport: $115
- Moscow to Spokane airport: $250

There are also ride share options (Lyft, Uber).  

The [Wheatland Express](https://starlinecollection.com/spokane-airport-express/) offers some options for transportation to the Spokane Airport for $59 each way. It is unclear at this time what their June schedule looks like. 

The Lewiston airport offers ground transportation to Moscow for $40 ([more information here](https://www.golws.com/travelers/ground-transportation/)). 

Moscow is a small, largely pedestrian-friendly, walkable town. You may not need a car at all once you reach your hotel. It is also very safe; the greatest danger at night is running into one of the town skunks.
